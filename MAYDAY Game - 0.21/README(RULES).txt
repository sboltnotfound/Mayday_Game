MAYDAY (Beta-0.21)
MADE BY SUBHAM CHAKRABORTY (S.BOLT)

Rules:-
1. The plane is controlled by "w" to go up, "s" to go down.
2. Avoid the mountains, I have developed the plane to have an accurate hitbox [the wings of plane are not hitbox because they are out of the planar region].
3. Mountains are generated randomly using a 10 digit number called seed [if you have played Minecraft you will know what it is]. 
4. Stall is what makes you not go up too much. Stall has 3 levels, level 0 is below 75% of height, level 1 is above 75% and below 90%, level 2 is above 90%.
5. There is a stall-meter, initially its 50% full, its increases in level 0(cyan color), and decreases in level 1(blue) & 2(red). if stall-meter hits 0 you lose.
6. Get the highest score! [ill later add a ending and boss fight].

UPDATES:-
-> Fixed "missing dll" & "this program cant run errors". (thanks to Shubh Rastogi for helping me in testing this)
-> More optimized (reduction of lag)
-> Written using c++ with SDL (simple directmedia layer Library)
